# RuntoSchool_Game
A basic HTML JS game which works on selecting the correct option on button to change the pictures to continue the storyline.

1. When Game starts, a button keeps flickering and player need to click it to select either 'progress' or 'regress'
2. If progress is clicked, player will be moved to next stage
3. If regress is clicked, player will be moved back to the previous stage and life is decreased.
4. Player need to reach the last phase or image to finish the game.
5. Player has five lives to complete the task.

The main game works on algorithm of event selection and changing image.

This is very small version of the game. Possibly in future, I'll add more stages and elements. Till then enjoy the simple game.
